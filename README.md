## **Minesweeper AI**
This Minesweeper AI is inspired by the classic Minesweeper game and uses Python programming language.

It is designed to play the Minesweeper game, by simply clicking the cell or using the AI to make a move on your behalf.  The AI player can make intelligent moves based on the game state and its knowledge of the board.

### **Gameplay**  
  
Click on a cell to reveal it.  
Right-click on a cell to mark it as a mine.  
The goal is to mark all mines successfully to win the game.  
If you reveal a mine, you lose the game.  

To run the Minesweeper AI, you can use the provided Python script runner.py. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.


### **Code Structure**
_minesweeper.py_: Contains the implementation of the Minesweeper class for the game representation, the logical Sentence class for the logical statements about the game, and the MinesweeperAI class for the game-playing AI.       

_runner.py_: Contains the logical implementation of the Minesweeper game.    

_README.md_: This file, providing instructions and information about the project.    

_requirements.txt_: Lists the required Python packages for running the AI.  



You can customize the game settings such as board height, width, and number of mines by modifying the parameters in the runner.py script.
